I'm trying to add normal maps to some video game sprites I'm making.
This tiny lil app will help me interpolate between colors.

Normally I'd write this in C++, but I wanted to see if I still know some old-school C.
Libraries for this already exist, but I'm writing my own stuff just for practice.



---------------------------
Usage:
  In your Unix/Posix shell, run the command:
      $ make main
  This compiles to a binary/executable file called "a.out", located in the same directory as the makefile.
  You can then just run the command:
    $ ./a.out
  This will execute the program.

  The command:
    $ make clean
  will remove the compiled binary.

  Note: the binary contains debugging info, in case you want to use GDB or something.


----------------------------
UPDATE 1/2/2022:
TO-DO:
  - Unit testing for color interpolation
  - Create UI / Menu System
  
  -- Possible future features:
      (1.) Parse PNG files
      (2.) Programmatically generate normal maps from PNG RGBA values
      (3.) Save normal maps as PNG files
